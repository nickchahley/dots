When you live in a command line, configurations are a deeply personal thing.
They are often crafted over years of experience, battles lost, lessons learned,
advice followed, and ingenuity rewarded. When you are away from your own
configurations, you are an orphaned refugee in unfamiliar and hostile
surroundings. You feel clumsy and out of sorts. You are filled with a sense of
longing to be back in a place you know. A place you built. A place where all the
short-cuts have been worn bare by your own travels. A place you proudly call…

Ordinarily, this would be the part of the review where I emote, explaining how
naked mole rats are, in fact, avatars of some kind of human experience. They
aren't. They're almost entirely other, from their insectoid colony, to their
cancer-free existence, to their awesome skills at surviving low-oxygen
environments, to their less-pained lifestyle. The naked mole rat has traded its
worldly concerns — vanity, seeing the sun, independence, self-expression — for
something else. The naked mole rat is beyond us, beyond our concerns. It's
covered in poop and feeling no pain. If only we could all be so lucky.

Emacs treats `undo` as just another command. Therefore you can undo the undo.
**This is powerful and confusing** because if you are doing several undos and
miss the “correct spot”, and do anything at all which is not an undo command,
you will be stuck: You broke the chain of undos. When you realize your mistake
and try to undo some more, you will first undo your previous undos, then undo
the dos, and then you can finally undo some more to find the correct spot. The
problem is at least as confusing as this description.

If you are understanding the words that are coming out of my mouth, then you

have an entire lifetime of rich, human experiences that define who you are.
Those games are not what's enriching your life, you are! You have the
imagination, the power, and the love to create the happiness that these games
fill you with.

Don't let anyone bring you down for who you are, and don't let anyone exploit
you for who you are. Don't let anyone sell your own identity back to you. You
don't need an excuse to like video games, that's just who you are; have
confidence in that. You don't need to risk your reputation and your privacy
getting involved with these shady online operations and wars over what people
can and can not say on the internet.

You don't need to fill your life with so much negativity just to express how
much you love something.

I feel like the mythology of [Sex and The City 2] has developed to the point
where Lazarus, which is the demon spirit that lives inside of Carrie's hat that
she wears at the wedding, has formed some sort of binary relationship with The
Rat King whereby you need to be supporting one or the other.

COMPUTER RANDOMLY PLAYS CLASSICAL MUSIC
Summary:  During normal operation or in Safe mode, your computer may play "Fur
Elise" or "It's a Small, Small World" seemingly at random. This is an indication
sent to the PC speaker from the computer's BIOS that the CPU fan is failing or
has failed, or that the power supply voltages have drifted out of tolerance.
This is a design feature of a detection circuit and system BIOSes developed by
Award/Unicore from 1997 on.

We wrapped up the second millennium with a rich language for describing how
information moves and morphs, and that language was coopted by the emerging
industry of working with information. To some degree, everybody rebelled
against this abstract lexicon, which is why we decided to grab yet more sports
metaphors and have scrum meetings. Seriously, what group of software engineers
would you describe as "agile" in the last century's interpretation of the word?

Since you and I are posting to gearslutz, that is a definite indication that
our intellect has indeed been already affected by these same soldering fumes...
otherwise we would have chosen some other more financially rewarding and

I ask Fieri: Where exactly is Flavortown, USA?

"On camera, I once said, 'This pizza looks like a manhole cover in Flavortown.'
Willy Wonka had a chocolate stream, you know? So it's taking these iconic food
items, these iconic food moments, and giving them a home. They all live in
Flavortown. It's like one of those things in The Matrix: You can only get down
with Flavortown if you believe in Flavortown. I have people walk up to me and
say, 'Hey, I'm a citizen of Flavortown.' I have people that want to pledge to
be a city council member of Flavortown or the mechanic. It doesn't stop. What
would be the airline of Flavortown? Sausage Airlines? It just doesn't stop. I
just said it, and then people heard it. Of course, there's no Flavortown --- 
unless you believe in it."

And it's really important to just take what life has given you and do your
best with it. Because, I'm not going to say that anyone--that people are able
to do anything; that's just empty words. But I will say that your limits are
probably way farther out than you'd expect. And if you push yourself, you can
probably be really happy and pleased with the results.
